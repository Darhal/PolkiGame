# PolkiGame

PolkiGame is my first  game ever created and also the first game ever created on Trikyta Engine. 

This is a combat turn per turn opposing a fighter (you) and a dragon. 
You have 3 choices at eacch beginning of your turn 
-A Sword
-Z Shooting An Arrow
-E Drink a potion

The sword is dealing 0 to 15 damages to the dragon and 0 to 7 damages to you
The Arrow is dealing 15 to the dragon but has only 1/3 chance to hit
The potion is usable if you have less than 30 HP and gives you 10HP, then 8, 6, 4, 2.

The dragon has one only attack Dragon charge and you have to choose beetwen
-UP to dodge
-Down to dodge
-Left to dodge
-Right to dodge

So as you can notice, the dragon has 1/4 chance to hit you but if he does hit you it will deal 15 to 30 damages to you.
