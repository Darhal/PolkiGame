# PolkiGame

PolkiGame is my first  game ever created and also the first game ever created on Trikyta Engine. <br/>

This is a combat turn per turn opposing a fighter (you) and a dragon. <br/>
You have 3 choices at eacch beginning of your turn <br/>
-A Sword<br/>
-Z Shooting An Arrow<br/>
-E Drink a potion<br/>

The sword is dealing 0 to 15 damages to the dragon and 0 to 7 damages to you<br/>
The Arrow is dealing 15 to the dragon but has only 1/3 chance to hit<br/>
The potion is usable if you have less than 30 HP and gives you 10HP, then 8, 6, 4, 2.<br/>

The dragon has one only attack Dragon charge and you have to choose beetwen<br/>
-UP to dodge<br/>
-Down to dodge<br/>
-Left to dodge<br/>
-Right to dodge<br/>

So as you can notice, the dragon has 1/4 chance to hit you but if he does hit you it will deal 15 to 30 damages to you.<br/>
